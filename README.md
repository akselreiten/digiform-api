# Digiform-api

The digiform-api directory contains a complete back-end setup for the web implementation of the DigiForm solution. The system is implemented using the front-end Angular 2 framework in cooperation with Python Django backend solutions. For styling purposes we have used Bulma, a modern CSS framework based on flexbox. 

## Quickstart:
- Clone digiform-api directory 
- Go to the digiform-api directory 
- Type "source venv/bin/activate" in the terminal to activate the venv
- Install required packages through typing in "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal
- Start digiform-api server through typing in "./manage.py runserver" in the terminal
